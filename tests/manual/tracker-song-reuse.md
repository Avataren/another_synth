# Tracker song reuse manual check

Steps to confirm instruments stay audible when reusing the same patch across songs:

1. Open the tracker and load Song A that uses a patch with audible sustain (e.g., pad with delay/reverb).
2. Start playback and verify the song outputs audio.
3. Without refreshing the page, load Song B that reuses the same patch ID (for example, duplicate Song A under a new name).
4. Start playback again. Audio should play immediately; the reused patch should not stay silent or require opening the patch editor.
5. Optionally, switch back to Song A to confirm repeated reuse keeps playback audible.
