//! SID waveform generator output: the 12-bit value presented to a voice's
//! waveform DAC, as a pure function of the control register, the voice's
//! 24-bit phase accumulator, its sync/ring source's accumulator, the
//! pulse-width register and the noise LFSR output.
//!
//! Model: combinational logic over the accumulator bits, one evaluation per
//! chip cycle.
//!
//! Sources (GPL-free): MOS 6581/8580 datasheet (control register bits,
//! "SYNC", "RING MOD", "TEST" descriptions); Bob Yannes' published interview
//! on the SID design (saw = upper 12 accumulator bits, triangle = MSB-folded
//! lower bits, pulse = 12-bit comparator, selected waveforms are wired
//! together on the same output lines); public C64 community hardware notes.
//!
//! - Sawtooth: accumulator bits 23..12. Exact.
//! - Triangle: bits 22..11, XOR-folded by the fold signal, output LSB 0.
//!   Without ring mod the fold signal is the voice's own MSB. Exact.
//! - Ring mod (control bit 2): the fold signal becomes
//!   `MSB(own) XOR NOT MSB(source)` (plan §1.2's wording, "triangle output XOR
//!   NOT MSB(osc B)"). INFERRED from the public die-level description that
//!   ring mod swaps the triangle's MSB for an XOR with the source MSB; the
//!   NOT is the plan's specified polarity. On its own it only shifts a
//!   static triangle by half a period (an inverted triangle is the same
//!   wave delayed by half a cycle). The ring-mod sound comes from the XOR.
//!   Ring mod touches only the triangle function. It has no effect unless
//!   TRI is selected, and in a combined waveform the triangle component is
//!   the ring-modulated one.
//! - Pulse: all ones when `acc[23:12] >= PW`, else zero. Exact. TEST forces
//!   the pulse output high. The datasheet says "the Pulse waveform output is
//!   held at a DC level"; the level being all ones is INFERRED from public
//!   hardware notes (the C64 "test-bit digi" technique relies on it).
//! - Noise: supplied by `noise.rs` (8 LFSR taps on DAC bits 11..4).
//! - Combined waveforms, 8580: the selected outputs share the waveform bit
//!   lines. The base is the bitwise AND of the selected 12-bit outputs (the
//!   public combinational-logic "wired-AND" view). The ideal AND is far too
//!   loud against the measured levels (S5.12 R2,
//!   `.ai/sid-chip-comparison-report.md` §2.1: pulse+saw about +6 dB,
//!   saw+tri about +10 dB). So pulse+saw, saw+tri and pulse+saw+tri go
//!   through the same neighbour-pull pass as the 6581 (below), with a
//!   weaker, per-combination threshold fitted to the measured mean level
//!   (`PULL_THRESHOLDS_8580`, DERIVED-VALUE disclosure there). Pulse+tri
//!   and noise combinations have no measured level and stay the plain AND.
//!   Noise in a combination also writes zeros back into the LFSR (see
//!   `noise.rs`).
//! - Combined waveforms, 6581 (S2). Public knowledge: the 6581's combined
//!   waveforms come out far weaker than the ideal AND. Saw+tri is mostly
//!   silent, and pulse+saw keeps only the upper part of the ramp. The
//!   public explanation is the same shared-bit-line picture, with stronger
//!   coupling on the 6581: a line held low by one waveform also drags its
//!   neighbours low, and the effect falls off with distance. Modelled as a
//!   pass over the ideal AND `a`:
//!     pull(i) = sum over bits j != i with a_j = 0 of 2^(11 - |i - j|)
//!     out bit i = a_i AND pull(i) < 1536
//!   The weight halves per bit of distance (a zero next door pulls 1024, one
//!   two bits away 512, ...), and the threshold 1536 = 0.75 * 2048. So an
//!   isolated one-bit inside the word always vanishes (a zero on each side
//!   = 2048). An edge bit (11 or 0) has only one neighbour. It vanishes
//!   when a long enough run of zeros follows it (e.g. 0x800 alone: 2047),
//!   but survives sparse zeros (bit 0 of 0x555: 1365). The bottom bit of a
//!   run that sits on a long run of zeros is eaten ("run-down"). Long runs
//!   of ones survive.
//!   All ones and all zeros are fixed points. The pass is not iterated, and
//!   it uses only the AND, not which waveforms made it.
//!   INFERRED: the neighbour-pull rule and its 2^-d weights are my own
//!   tuning to match the qualitative description. No measured 6581
//!   combined-waveform table was used: the published ones sit inside GPL
//!   emulators. It applies only when two or more waveforms are selected, so
//!   a single waveform is untouched.
//!   Thresholds (S5.12 R2): the S2 threshold 0.75 left the 6581 about
//!   +20 dB too loud on pulse+saw (report §2.2). Pulse+saw, saw+tri and
//!   pulse+saw+tri now use per-combination thresholds fitted to the
//!   measured mean levels (`PULL_THRESHOLDS_6581`, DERIVED-VALUE disclosure
//!   there). Pulse+tri and noise combinations keep 0.75
//!   (`PULL_THRESHOLD_6581`), because no level was measured for them.
//!   Because a lower threshold only removes more bits, each 6581
//!   combination is a bit subset of the 8580 one at the same phase.
//!   Precomputed into 4096-entry tables (`COMBINED_6581`,
//!   `COMBINED_FITTED_*`), because it runs every chip cycle. Ears-gate.
//! - No waveform selected ("waveform 0"): the DAC input floats and keeps
//!   the last output. INFERRED from public hardware notes. `waveform_output`
//!   returns `None` and the voice keeps its previous value. On the 8580 the
//!   slow leak of the held value is not modelled. On the 6581 (S2) the held
//!   value fades to 0 after a fixed time; see `voice.rs`. The TEST bit
//!   does not drive the DAC when no waveform is selected, so TEST with
//!   waveform 0 changes nothing here: the held value stays, and on the 6581
//!   its fade keeps running.
