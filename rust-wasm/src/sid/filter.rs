//! 8580 filter: a zero-delay-feedback (topology-preserving transform)
//! state-variable filter at the output sample rate. 2 poles, 12 dB/oct LP/HP,
//! 6 dB/oct BP; the three taps are summed per the mode bits ($D418 bits 4-6).
//!
//! Sources (GPL-free): MOS 6581/8580 datasheet (12 dB/oct LP/HP, 6 dB/oct BP
//! from one filter, 30 Hz..12 kHz cutoff range, 4-bit resonance, summable
//! modes); public descriptions of the 8580 filter as near-linear with
//! clean, moderate, non-self-oscillating resonance.
//!
//! Why an SVF (kept from the accepted S0 spike): the SID filter is a
//! two-integrator-loop state-variable filter. Its LP/BP/HP taps and
//! resonance-by-damping are the datasheet's modes exactly, and summing the
//! taps gives the notch (LP+HP) and the other combinations for free. TPT is
//! stable for any cutoff below Nyquist and keeps the resonance peak in
//! place at high cutoffs, which a naive Chamberlin SVF does not. On the
//! plan's "3-pole" wording, see `.ai/sid-voice-core-verdict.md`: the
//! datasheet's slopes fix 2 poles, and no third pole is added.
//!
//! Register maps (8580): both are INFERRED tuning choices, not
//! measurements. They are carried unchanged from S0 and are ears-gate items.
//! - Cutoff: 11-bit register (FC_LO bits 0-2, FC_HI bits 0-7). The 8580 curve
//!   is documented as near-linear over the datasheet range, so
//!   fc = 30 + reg * (12000 - 30) / 2047 Hz (5.85 Hz per step).
//! - Resonance: Q = 0.707 * 2^(res / 8). Butterworth at 0, +8.3 dB peak at 15.
//! - Ceiling (S5.12, both models): `Filter::set` clamps the mapped cutoff to
//!   4 kHz, the limit GoatTracker 2's reSID playback applies
//!   (`CUTOFF_CEILING_DELTA_HZ`). The maps themselves stay unclamped.
//! Linear: no saturation. The 8580 is "clean", not perfectly so.
//!
//! 6581 (S2, plan §1.2 "static nonlinear remap of the cutoff register +
//! level-dependent peak gain"). Same SVF, same taps, same mode bits; three
//! things differ, all gated on `SidModel::Sid6581`:
//! - Cutoff map (S5.12 R2; S2's logistic curve replaced). Public knowledge
//!   (C64 community measurements of many chips): the 6581 cutoff is
//!   strongly nonlinear in the register. The bottom of the range barely
//!   moves and the floor sits in the low hundreds of Hz rather than at the
//!   datasheet's 30 Hz. It also varies a lot from chip to chip. The
//!   published nominal curve has two pieces: FC_HI bit 7 has its own DAC
//!   weight, so the curve steps DOWN from ~6 kHz at 0x3FF to ~4.6 kHz at
//!   0x400 and then rises again to 18 kHz. Modelled as log-linear
//!   interpolation through measured anchors, one anchor set per piece:
//!     0 220 Hz, 0x200 420, 0x300 1600, 0x3FF 6000 |
//!     0x400 4600, 0x500 9500, 0x600 14500, 0x7FF 18000
//!   Each piece is strictly monotonic. The 0x3FF -> 0x400 drop is the one
//!   deliberate non-monotonicity. The anchors are measured facts and the
//!   values between them are derived; see the DERIVED-VALUE disclosure at
//!   `CUTOFF_ANCHORS_6581_LO`. The old map was 2-3x too dark across FC_HI
//!   $50-$7F (report §6.3). Ears-gate.
//! - Resonance map: Q = 0.707 * 2^(res / 12) (Butterworth at 0, Q 1.68 =
//!   +4.5 dB at 15). INFERRED from the public description of the 6581's
//!   resonance as clearly weaker and rounder than the 8580's; the exponent
//!   is a tuning guess. Ears-gate.
//! - Level-dependent peak gain. The 6581 filter's integrators are not
//!   linear at the levels real mixes drive them to (public: the "gritty",
//!   distorting 6581 filter, strongest at high resonance and with several
//!   voices filtered). Modelled as a soft limit on the band-pass
//!   integrator state after each update:
//!     s1 <- SAT * tanh(s1 / SAT)
//!   Small signals are untouched (tanh(u) = u - u^3/3 + ...: the relative
//!   change is ~u^2/3, under 1e-3 for states below 0.05), so the
//!   small-signal peak is still Q.
//!   At full level the band-pass state is clamped below SAT, the resonant
//!   peak compresses and the output picks up odd harmonics. The band-pass
//!   state carries no DC, so the 6581's DC offsets (`voice.rs`) do not bias
//!   it. INFERRED: the placement (one limiter on the resonant state) and
//!   SAT = 1.0 (one full-scale voice) are tuning choices. Ears-gate.
//!   Not modelled: the real filter's input-dependent cutoff shift. The plan
//!   approximates it by the static remap, which is what this is.
