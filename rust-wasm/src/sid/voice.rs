//! One SID voice: 24-bit phase accumulator, waveform latch, noise LFSR,
//! envelope and the waveform x envelope DAC product.
//!
//! The voice is driven by `Chip`, which owns the per-cycle ordering because
//! sync and ring mod couple voices together (see `chip.rs`). Everything a
//! caller can observe is exposed read-only here. Writes go through the
//! chip's register interface.
//!
//! Sources (GPL-free): MOS 6581/8580 datasheet (frequency/pulse-width
//! registers, control bits, "Fout = Fn * Fclk / 2^24"); public hardware notes.
//!
//! - Accumulator: `acc = (acc + freq) mod 2^24` each cycle. Exact.
//! - TEST bit: the accumulator is reset to 0 and held there while TEST is
//!   set (datasheet: "resets and locks Oscillator 1 at zero until the TEST
//!   bit is cleared"). Exact. For its effect on noise and pulse see
//!   `noise.rs` and `waveform.rs`.
//! - DAC (8580): linear, zero point at the waveform midpoint, so the voice
//!   output is `(wave - 0x800) / 0x800 * env / 255`. INFERRED from the
//!   8580 being documented as having near-linear DACs and none of the
//!   6581's large per-voice DC offset.
//!
//! 6581 (S2), all gated on `SidModel::Sid6581`:
//! - DAC DC offset. Public knowledge: the 6581's waveform DAC is not
//!   centred on its zero point, so every voice carries a DC level that the
//!   envelope scales. That is why 6581 gate edges thump and why
//!   envelope/volume "digis" are loud on a 6581. Modelled as a constant
//!   added to the normalised waveform before the envelope product:
//!     out = ((wave - 0x800) / 0x800 + VOICE_DC_6581) * amp
//!   INFERRED: the sign (positive) follows the public "zero point below
//!   mid-scale" description; the size 0.25 (a quarter of half-scale) is a
//!   tuning guess. Behind the chip's 16 Hz DC blocker this shows up as a
//!   thump on note-on/off and on envelope moves, never as a steady offset.
//!   Ears-gate.
//! - Attack shape. The plan (§1.2) cites a published 6581 measurement: a
//!   ~1.5 ms floor and a nonlinear attack shape. No GPL-free copy of that
//!   curve was available here, so the plan's figure is taken at face value
//!   and turned into a model: the envelope counter and the shared rate
//!   table are untouched (ENV3 still reads the linear digital level), but
//!   the amplitude the voice applies, `amp`, follows the level through a
//!   one-pole lag that acts on RISING level only:
//!     target = level / 255
//!     amp <- amp + (target - amp) * alpha   if target > amp
//!     amp <- target                         otherwise
//!     alpha = 1 - e^(-1 / tau),  tau = 1.5 ms / ln 9 * 985 248 = 672.61 cycles
//!   ln 9 makes the 10 %-90 % rise of a full-scale step exactly 1.5 ms: that
//!   is the "floor", since no attack can rise faster. A ramp of length T
//!   comes out as (t - tau (1 - e^(-t/tau))) / T: a slow, curved onset,
//!   then a straight line one tau late. At the fastest nibble (T = 255 * 9
//!   cycles = 2.33 ms) the whole attack is curved; slow attacks are just
//!   delayed by tau. Decay and release follow the level exactly, and so
//!   does any fall after the lag has caught up (no step at the stage change).
//!   Why a lag and not a stateless level -> amplitude table (the plan's
//!   "table lookup"): a table applied only in attack jumps when the stage
//!   changes mid-attack (gate off at level L would snap from table(L) to
//!   L/255), and a table applied in every stage changes every sustain level.
//!   INFERRED: the one-pole form and the 10-90 % reading of "1.5 ms floor".
//!   Ears-gate.
//! - Waveform 0 fade. With no waveform selected the DAC input floats (see
//!   `waveform.rs`). Public notes say the held value leaks away, far faster
//!   on the 6581 than on the 8580. Modelled as: after WAVE0_FADE_CYCLES_6581
//!   consecutive cycles with no waveform, the held value drops to 0. TEST
//!   does not drive the DAC and neither restarts nor stops the count. The
//!   8580 keeps S1's hold. INFERRED: the hold time (65 536 cycles,
//!   66.5 ms) and the single drop instead of a gradual leak. Ears-gate.
