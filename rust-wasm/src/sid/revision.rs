//! 6581 die-revision profiles (S5.15). Every characteristic that could
//! differ between 6581 die revisions lives here, in one `RevisionProfile`,
//! so a later pass can add a revision (R3) by adding a profile and changing
//! `SID6581_REVISION`. Nothing else in the engine names a revision.
//!
//! Selection is engine-side: `SidModel::Sid6581` always plays
//! `profile_6581()`. No .sng/.sid field encodes the die revision, so there
//! is nothing in the file format to read it from.
//!
//! Sources (GPL-free; `.ai/sid-r4ar-research-notes.md`):
//! - Wikipedia, "MOS Technology 6581", Revisions: the 6581 went through R2,
//!   R3, R4 and R4AR with "no substantial alterations", only input-pin
//!   protection/buffering, silicon grade and packaging changes.
//! - C64-Wiki, "SID": 6581R4AR was produced 22/1986-06/1987, the last 6581.
//!   Trivia: every write to the 6581's volume register gave an audible click
//!   (the $D418 sample trick); on the 8580 "samples were inaudible".
//!
//! Trait classification. Only the volume DAC is new in S5.15; the rest is
//! earlier work moved here unchanged:
//! - Cutoff curve: GENERIC-6581. The public record gives 6581-vs-8580
//!   nonlinearity but no per-revision anchors. The R4AR profile carries the
//!   S5.12 measured-anchor curve as is. The published nominal curve's range
//!   (220 Hz..18 kHz) is quoted for the 6581 generally — the record does not
//!   break it down per die revision; R4AR is consistent with it.
//! - FC_HI $7F -> $80 step: GENERIC-6581. It is the 0x3FF -> 0x400 drop
//!   between the two anchor sets. No revision-specific position or shape is
//!   invented.
//! - Output DC (voice DC, mixer DC) and the gain derived from them:
//!   GENERIC-6581. They keep S2's INFERRED values (`voice.rs`, `chip.rs`).
//! - Volume DAC: GENERIC-6581 vs 8580. The 8580 stays linear, VOL / 15. See
//!   `R4AR` for the INFERRED 6581 table.
//!
//! `R3` and `R4` are MEASURED on real chips, cutoff only: filter sweeps and
//! music recorded from Stone Oakvalley's Authentic SID Collection (SOASC),
//! one physical chip each (method and data: `.ai/sid-soasc/NOTES.md`). Chips
//! of one revision vary about as much as the revisions do, so each profile
//! is "that chip", not the revision as a whole. Neither has the 4 kHz
//! ceiling GoatTracker's playback has (`cutoff_ceiling_hz`).
