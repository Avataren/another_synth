//! MOS SID (6581/8580) voice core, S1 of `.ai/plan-sid-tracking.md`.
//!
//! Model: a cycle-counted digital core (phase accumulators, waveform bit
//! logic, sync, ring mod, test bit, noise LFSR, envelope generators) at the
//! PAL clock of 985 248 Hz, under a sample-rate analog path (boxcar
//! decimation, 2-pole state-variable filter, volume, output coupling) at
//! 44.1 kHz (or another output rate). This is the plan §1.1 approximation, not
//! cycle-exact audio. See `chip.rs` for the sample-rate caveats.
//!
//! Both revisions are implemented, chosen per `Chip` instance. The 8580 is
//! S1. The 6581 is S2's character pass over the same skeleton: every 6581
//! behaviour is gated on the model, so the 8580 paths are unchanged
//! (pinned bit-exactly by `tests_s2::pin_8580_render_is_bit_identical_to_s1`).
//! S2's record is `.ai/sid-6581-verdict.md`.
//!
//! Sources: the MOS 6581/8580 datasheet, Bob Yannes' published interview,
//! and public C64 community hardware measurements and notes. No GPL
//! emulator code or tables were consulted or copied (plan §8.3). Each
//! module's header lists its sources and marks every INFERRED choice.
//! Grown from the accepted S0 spike (`.ai/sid-spike-verdict.md`). S1's record
//! is `.ai/sid-voice-core-verdict.md`.
//!
//! S3 adds the song: `song.rs` reads and writes the SID song file the app's
//! `SidDoc` saves, and `player.rs` plays it on a chip of the song's model.
//! S3's record is `.ai/sid-song-model-verdict.md`.
//!
//! S4 adds what the browser needs: `wasm.rs` (`SidPlayer`, the worklet's
//! class), per-voice taps and a voice mask on the chip, and the player's
//! song-row transport (seek, row loop, preview voice). S4's record is
//! `.ai/sid-editor-verdict.md`.
