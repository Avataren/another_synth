//! SID envelope generator: an 8-bit up/down envelope counter clocked by a
//! 15-bit rate counter, with an extra "exponential" divider in decay and
//! release. Cycle-counted at the chip clock.
//!
//! Sources (GPL-free): MOS 6581/8580 datasheet "Envelope Rates" table;
//! published hardware measurements of the rate periods and exponential
//! breakpoints by the C64 community; public descriptions of the "ADSR delay
//! bug".
//!
//! - Attack/decay/release times: the datasheet gives attack 2 ms .. 8 s,
//!   with decay/release 3x the attack time for the same nibble, at 1 MHz. The
//!   nominal rate period is `time * 1e6 / 256` cycles. The table holds the
//!   MEASURED periods, which sit 0..1.6 cycles above nominal because the
//!   datasheet rounds its times. Derivation, nibble: datasheet ms ->
//!   ms*1000/256 -> measured period
//!     0:     2 ->     7.8 ->     9      8:   100 ->   390.6 ->   392
//!     1:     8 ->    31.3 ->    32      9:   250 ->   976.6 ->   977
//!     2:    16 ->    62.5 ->    63     10:   500 ->  1953.1 ->  1954
//!     3:    24 ->    93.8 ->    95     11:   800 ->  3125.0 ->  3126
//!     4:    38 ->   148.4 ->   149     12:  1000 ->  3906.3 ->  3907
//!     5:    56 ->   218.8 ->   220     13:  3000 -> 11718.8 -> 11720
//!     6:    68 ->   265.6 ->   267     14:  5000 -> 19531.3 -> 19532
//!     7:    80 ->   312.5 ->   313     15:  8000 -> 31250.0 -> 31251
//!   The 8580 and 6581 share the envelope circuit, so this one table serves
//!   both models, and this counter is identical on both (ENV3 reads it).
//!   The 6581's attack-curve shape (S2, plan §1.2) lives after the counter,
//!   in the amplitude the voice applies: see `voice.rs`.
//! - Rate counter: 15 bits, +1 per cycle, free-running across gate changes.
//!   The step fires when it EQUALS the selected period, and the counter
//!   then resets to 0. INFERRED from public descriptions: an equality
//!   compare is what produces the documented ADSR delay bug. When the period
//!   is lowered below the counter's current value, the counter has to run
//!   on to 0x7FFF, wrap, and count up again (up to ~33 ms) before the next
//!   step.
//! - Attack is linear: +1 per rate period to 255, then decay starts.
//! - Decay/release are piecewise exponential: the counter steps down once
//!   every N rate periods, N chosen from the current level. Measured
//!   breakpoints: level > 93 -> 1, 55..=93 -> 2, 27..=54 -> 4, 15..=26 -> 8,
//!   7..=14 -> 16, 1..=6 -> 30.
//! - Sustain level = the S nibble in both nibbles (S * 17). INFERRED
//!   (public descriptions of the comparator): decay stops when the level
//!   EQUALS the sustain value. Lowering S mid-sustain resumes the decay. Raising
//!   it above the current level never matches, so the decay runs on to 0.
//! - Zero freeze: a step that lands on 0 freezes the counter there, and
//!   only a gate-on (attack) unlocks it. The freeze is a latch, not "level
//!   is 0": a gate-on clears it even if no attack step follows, and a
//!   release step from an unfrozen 0 wraps the 8-bit counter to 255, which
//!   then releases from full level. The same wrap runs the other way: an
//!   attack step from 255 lands on 0 and freezes. reSID models both, as
//!   measured on ENV3. Songs lean on the first: a one-frame gate-on whose
//!   attack step the ADSR delay bug holds back (Stinsen's "Tribal
//!   Tribunal", voices 2 and 3) plays its whole release, and holding at 0
//!   instead silenced those voices.
//! - The TEST bit does not touch the envelope. The datasheet's TEST text
//!   names only the oscillator, noise and pulse outputs.
//!
//! Not modelled: the one-cycle pipeline delays on gate and register writes
//! (writes land between chip cycles here).
