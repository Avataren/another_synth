//! The SID song player, S3 of `.ai/plan-sid-tracking.md`: plays a `SidSong`
//! (`song.rs`, the file the app's `SidDoc` saves) on one `Chip`, built with
//! the song's own model (the per-song tag S2 deferred), by writing the chip's
//! registers once per frame, as a C64 playroutine does.
//!
//! Timing: one frame is `frame_cycles(speed_multiplier)` chip cycles, the
//! real C64 rate a GoatTracker song is written for (GT-parity 0925b): at 1x
//! the PAL vertical blank, 312 lines x 63 = 19 656 cycles, 985 248 / 19 656
//! = 50.1245 Hz (GT exports a 1x tune on the VBI: greloc.c:1590-1596); at
//! multispeed m GT's CIA timer, latch $4CC7 / m, a period of latch + 1
//! (greloc.c:1551-1562), = 19 656 / m for m = 2, 3, 4, 6, 8. Until 0925b it
//! was exactly 50 Hz x m, which is GT's EDITOR (gsound.h:24, its mixer calls
//! the player every mixrate / 50 samples, bme_snd.c:386): 0.249 % slower than
//! the exported tune. The TS engine's BPM (`sidDocTiming`, 125 per 1x) stays
//! an approximation for the grid; this player owns the transport. A row
//! lasts `tempo` frames, the doc's start tempo, until a
//! tempo command: each channel has GT's own tick counter and tempo (S5.18,
//! `tick_step`), so funktempo (E) alternates two row lengths and F with bit 7
//! sets one channel's alone. Frames
//! land on output-sample boundaries (the chip's own write granularity,
//! `chip.rs`), accumulated fractionally, so no frame drifts.
//!
//! Per frame, in this order (INFERRED ordering, a plain playroutine's):
//!   1. on the row's first frame, every channel reads its row: an instrument
//!      number selects the instrument; a note 1..=93 (transposed by the
//!      orderlist entry as GT's u8 arithmetic does, never clamped: S5.10,
//!      `note_index`) triggers it: the
//!      instrument's AD/SR and table pointers are loaded (a GT instrument has
//!      no waveform, pulse width or filter of its own: the channel keeps its
//!      own until a table sets them), the gate goes on and the first-frame
//!      waveform is held as the waveform (`trigger`); key off clears the gate, key on sets it; then
//!      the row's command;
//!   2. per channel the wave table, then, unless a wave step set a note
//!      (GT ends the frame there, gplay.c:722), the running command (1, 2,
//!      3, 4, or 0's instrument vibrato); the pulse table; then the (global)
//!      filter table;
//!   3. the hard restart: `gate_timer` frames before a row that triggers a
//!      note, the gate is cleared (unless that row's instrument has
//!      `no_gate_off`), and with that instrument's `hard_restart` AD $0F /
//!      SR 0 (S5.17, S5.19);
//!   4. every register is written: per voice frequency, pulse
//!      width, AD, SR, then control (`waveform & gate mask`, below); then
//!      cutoff, resonance/routing and mode/volume.
//!
//! The control byte (S5.9, GT2 source): the waveform is a whole control
//! byte, gate bit included, as GoatTracker keeps it (`cptr->wave`), and the
//! channel's gate is a MASK over it, 0xFF on, 0xFE off (gplay.c:129, 148,
//! 362, 916, 918, 926); the register is `waveform & mask` (gplay.c:945). So
//! a wave-table row or command 7 with the gate bit clear releases the note
//! even while the channel's gate is on (the classic drum ending, `$80` noise
//! or `$40` pulse), a gate-set row after it retriggers, and after a key off
//! no waveform byte raises the gate.
//!
//! Commands (the row's command nibble and parameter; GoatTracker's command
//! set, from its format documentation, interpreted here, not copied):
//!   0 none; 1/2 portamento up/down and 3 tone portamento at the 16-bit
//!   register speed held in speed-table row `param` (left<<8 | right);
//!   4 vibrato with speed-table row `param`, GoatTracker's (S5.10,
//!   `vibrato`: left = turn value, $80 up fine mode, right = register step);
//!   5 AD = param; 6 SR = param;
//!   7 waveform = param (the whole byte, gate bit included, gplay.c:433);
//!   8/9/A start the wave/pulse/filter table at row
//!   `param`; B resonance/routing ($17) = param; C cutoff high byte = param;
//!   D master volume = param & 15; E funktempo: the two row lengths of speed
//!   row `param` (minus 1: GT's `funktable`) alternate on every channel
//!   (gplay.c:483-492); F tempo: from 3 up the row length minus 1, 0-2 as
//!   they are (0 and 1 are funktempo), on all channels or, with bit 7, on this
//!   one (gplay.c:494-508). A row with command 3 and
//!   a note glides to it instead of triggering; with parameter 0 (GT's
//!   tie-note, readme §3.2) the pitch jumps to it on the row's second frame
//!   (tick 1; GT's realtime optimisation skips tick 0, goattrk2.c:55,
//!   gplay.c:728) and is re-asserted every tick the command stands
//!   (gplay.c:807-811), still without a trigger; wave-table note rows pass
//!   through under it and win their frame (gplay.c:714-722, 722). Pinned in
//!   S5, phase and passthrough aligned in S5.6 against the `.sng` corpus and
//!   the GT2 source.
//!   S5.10, GT's running command (gplay.c:351-358, 397-428): a new note sets
//!   it to 0 with the instrument's speed row and vibrato delay; commands 0-4
//!   replace it; 5-F leave it, so a vibrato or a slide runs on under them.
//!   Command 0 runs the instrument vibrato: a delay of 0 never, above 1
//!   counting down, at 1 swinging (gplay.c:767-772). Every tick effect (the
//!   vibratos 0 and 4, the slides 1-2, the portamento 3 and `3 00`) skips
//!   tick 0 of a row, as GT's realtime optimisation (on by default,
//!   goattrk2.c:55; readme "-R") does (gplay.c:728; player.s:971-979): S5.10
//!   for the vibratos, S5.12 for 1-3 (`tests_s512.rs`). Wave-table commands
//!   $F1-$F4 are not tick effects and run on any tick (gplay.c:529-691).
//!
//! Tables (1-based rows; left 0xFF = jump to row `right`, 0 = stop; one
//! jump per frame):
//!   wave: left 0x01..=0x0F waits that many frames, then sets the row's note
//!     (the row lasts left + 1 frames; pinned in S5); 0x10..=0xDF
//!     sets the waveform to `left` whole, 0xE0..=0xEF to `left & 0x0F`, the
//!     gate bit kept in both (gplay.c:525, 527; S5.9), 0x00 keeps it,
//!     0xF0..=0xFE (GT's table commands, `wave_command`): the pattern
//!     command of the low nibble with the right column as its parameter,
//!     for that frame (S5.17: $F5/$F6; S5.19: the rest). $F0, $F8 and $FE
//!     have no GT meaning: they are illegal (readme §3.4.1), GT's editor
//!     stops the song on them (gplay.c:534-538) and its packer refuses to
//!     export one (greloc.c:401-409); here the row only advances, as GT's
//!     does on that frame, and the song plays on. right, GT's arithmetic
//!     (S5.10, gplay.c:714-721): 0x00..=0x7F added to the channel's note,
//!     0x80 no change, 0x81..=0xFF the absolute note, then `& 0x7F`, into the
//!     128-entry table (96 notes, then zeros: `gt_note_freq_reg`). This right
//!     column is the arpeggio;
//!   pulse: left 0x80..=0xFE sets the width to (left & 0x0F)<<8 | right;
//!     0x01..=0x7F adds the signed `right` to it for `left` frames;
//!   filter: left 0x00 sets the cutoff high byte to `right`; 0x01..=0x7F
//!     adds the signed `right` to it for `left` frames; 0x80..=0xFE sets the
//!     mode to (left >> 4) & 7 (LP 1, BP 2, HP 4) and $17 (resonance<<4 |
//!     routing) to `right`;
//!   speed: data only, read by commands 1-4 and the instrument vibrato.
//! INFERRED throughout, from GoatTracker's documented table semantics; S5
//! pins them against real `.sng` files and adjusts this header with them.
//! No reference recording exists for a SID song played here (the S0-S2
//! caveat): what this player is proven to do is what its tests assert.
//!
//! S4 (the browser worklet, `wasm.rs`) adds what a transport needs:
//!   - the song row: rows started since the top (`song_row`), and the song's
//!     length in rows (`song_rows`, the longest channel's first pass, the
//!     app's grid length, `projectSidPatterns`);
//!   - `seek_row`: a fresh sequencer replayed to the row frame by frame
//!     without rendering (cheap: no chip cycles), then given the chip that was
//!     running. The registers are right at the row, and a note that sounded
//!     before carries on until a row retriggers it; the envelopes of notes
//!     started during the replay are NOT advanced (they start from wherever the
//!     running chip's are), so a seek lands "cold" on held notes;
//!   - a row-range loop (`set_loop_rows`, the tracker's "play pattern"): at
//!     the range's end the player seeks back to its start on the same chip;
//!   - a preview voice (`set_preview`): no sequencer; channel 1 is played by
//!     `preview_note_on` / `preview_note_off` with the song's instruments,
//!     tables and vibrato running as they do for a song note;
//!   - per-voice taps and mute/solo (`render_taps`, `Chip::set_voice_mask`).
