//! Band-limited ("hi-fi") oscillators for the AHX/HVL mixer, built the way the
//! rest of this crate builds mipmapped wavetables (`nodes/wavetable.rs`):
//! construct the spectrum, zero every bin above a level's Nyquist, inverse-FFT.
//!
//! ## What the reference does, and why it aliases
//!
//! A voice plays a cyclic table of `N = 4 << wave_length` signed bytes (4..128)
//! straight out of `voice_buffer`, nearest-neighbour at a 16.16 step: no
//! interpolation, no band limit. Read at a step of `f0` cycles per output
//! sample, the staircase's harmonics -- and the images of the staircase itself
//! -- above Nyquist fold back below it. On a high note that lands as
//! inharmonic garbage, including energy far below the pitch.
//!
//! ## What hi-fi does
//!
//! The waveform the reference *means* is the continuous staircase
//! `s(t) = x[floor(t * N)]`. Its Fourier series is exact and closed-form:
//!
//! ```text
//! c_0 = X_0 / N
//! c_k = X_(k mod N) * e^(-i*pi*k/N) * sin(pi*k/N) / (pi*k)        (k >= 1)
//! ```
//!
//! with `X` the N-point DFT of the table (the `sin` term is the zero-order
//! hold's sinc, so the staircase images are kept -- below Nyquist they are
//! part of the sound). A mip level keeps harmonics `1..=H`, inverse-FFTs them
//! into a [`table_size_for`]`(H)`-point cycle and is used only while
//! `H * f0 <= Nyquist`, so nothing above Nyquist exists to fold. That is the
//! whole idea: the reference sound, minus exactly the part that cannot be
//! represented.
//!
//! * **Table size** follows the level: 64 points per period of the top partial
//!   (`next_pow2(64 * H)`), clamped to `64..=`[`TABLE_SIZE`], and never below
//!   the cycle's own `N` (so `size / N` stays a whole number). The table is
//!   read with linear interpolation, which images the top partial around
//!   multiples of the table's point rate: with only 8 points per period those
//!   images fold back 50-60 dB down on a thin level, with 64 they sit at or
//!   under what a fixed 4096-point table gave. Levels with 45 or more partials
//!   keep 4096 points (level 0 still has 8 per period, buried under 511 other
//!   partials, as it always was); only the thinner ones shrink.
//!
//! * **Levels** are a geometric ladder of harmonic counts (`LEVELS_PER_OCTAVE`
//!   per octave, from [`MAX_HARMONICS`] down to 1) and are built lazily, the
//!   first time a voice needs one.
//! * **Sources** are keyed by the table's *contents*, not by a parameter pair.
//!   That covers every way AHX makes a table without enumerating them: the
//!   per-frame square duty (`CalcSquare`'s 32 widths, subsampled per wave
//!   length), the filter-sweep rows (a lowpass/highpass row is just a
//!   different table), triangle and sawtooth at each wave length. Equal
//!   contents share one spectrum and one set of levels.
//! * **DC is kept** (the reference's squares carry a duty-dependent DC and its
//!   sawtooth a half-LSB one); `wavetable.rs` zeroes DC because its sources are
//!   symmetric. The Nyquist bin is never populated: `H <= size / 8` at every
//!   level (level 0's 512 partials in 4096 points is the tightest).
//!
//! ## The AHX filter
//!
//! AHX's "filter" is not a stage on the oscillator output: it is baked into
//! the wave tables (`waveform::gen_filter_waves`, 31 low- and 31 high-pass
//! rows selected by `filter.pos`). A voice on a filtered row simply plays a
//! different `N`-byte table, and hi-fi band-limits *that* table. The filter
//! response is therefore untouched (resonant peaks and all, up to Nyquist);
//! only what could not have been represented is removed. Nothing is filtered
//! twice and nothing here depends on the filter's internals.
//!
//! ## What stays reference-authentic
//!
//! * **Noise** (`WAVEFORM_NOISE`): a 0x280-byte pseudo-random buffer, not a
//!   periodic table, so there is no harmonic series to truncate. Its aliasing
//!   is a different problem and a different fix (a noise source has no
//!   fundamental to fold). It plays the reference path.
//! * **Ring modulation**: the modulator stays the reference's byte table. The
//!   product of two waves has sum and difference partials that neither
//!   factor's band limit bounds, so band-limiting the factors would not
//!   deliver what it promises.
//!
//! Hi-fi is off in the engine by default and, off, is not merely equivalent
//! but *the same code path*: the mixer's `HIFI` const-generic is `false`, and
//! nothing here runs. The render goldens hold byte for byte. (The *app* always
//! turns it on, unconditionally, through `AhxPlayer::set_hifi` (the worklet's
//! `set-hifi`, sent as soon as its client exists); the engine's own default,
//! and the golden harness that drives it directly, are unaffected.)
//!
//! ## Prewarm: the render path never builds a table
//!
//! Building a level is an inverse FFT plus a quantise (~0.1 ms), and a tick
//! on many voices can want a dozen cold ones at once -- against a 2.7 ms
//! render quantum. So the product path never builds inside `render`: the
//! bank has three [`BankMode`]s. `Lazy` (the engine default, what the tests
//! use) builds on demand. `Prewarm` builds on demand too, but never evicts and
//! stops at the cap. `Locked` only *looks up*: a miss is counted, and the voice
//! takes the nearest built level with fewer partials of the same table (duller,
//! never aliased), or failing that the reference path for that tick. The
//! decision is a plain lookup: no lock is taken and nothing blocks.
//!
//! Who builds, and when, depends on the engine:
//!
//! * **A song** is prewarmed as a whole: `AhxEngine::prewarm_hifi` runs the
//!   song's ticks (no mixing) in `Prewarm` mode, then locks; see there for
//!   what that covers.
//! * **The keyboard preview** plays whatever key is pressed, so there is no
//!   song to walk. Its bank is `Locked` from the start, and each note-on
//!   (`AhxEngine::live_note_on`, called from the worklet's message handler,
//!   between render quanta) prewarms the pressed instrument at the pressed
//!   pitch by running its ticks -- sweeps and all -- on a scratch voice, then
//!   locks again. A table a held note reaches that the scratch run did not (a
//!   sweep longer than the simulated hold) is a miss, degraded for that tick
//!   and counted, not built.
//!
//! Neither builds on the render path, but a build is still CPU on the thread
//! that runs the audio worklet: the preview's prewarm is a burst in the
//! message handler, between quanta. It is paid once per (instrument, note) and
//! is mostly cache hits after the first note of a level.
//!
//! Zero new dependencies: `rustfft` is what `wavetable.rs` already uses.
