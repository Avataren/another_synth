//! `AhxPlayer`: the wasm-facing shell around [`AhxEngine`] (P4).
//!
//! The engine renders interleaved `i16` stereo, exactly what `hvl_DecodeFrame`
//! writes, because that is what the bit-exact goldens compare. An
//! `AudioWorkletProcessor` wants planar `f32` in `[-1, 1)`, one channel array
//! per output. This module is that adapter and nothing else: no DSP, no
//! transport decisions, so the bit-exactness proven in `tests/` is untouched
//! (the adapter is tested against the engine's own `i16` stream).
//!
//! The wasm-bindgen attribute is `cfg_attr`-gated on the `wasm` feature the
//! same way `audio_engine/wasm.rs` does it, so the whole class also compiles
//! and is unit-tested natively.
