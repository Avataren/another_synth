//! `AhxEngine`: the transport + mixer around the per-channel `Voice`s.
//! Ported from `hvl_InitSubsong` (`hvl_replay.c:67-113`), `hvl_process_step`
//! and its three effect passes (`:621-979`), `hvl_play_irq` (`:1635-1697`),
//! `hvl_mixchunk` (`:1699-1800`) and `hvl_DecodeFrame` (`:1802-1817`).
//!
//! Plain Rust, no wasm bindings (P3 scope). Output is interleaved `i16`
//! stereo, exactly what `hvl_DecodeFrame` writes, so it can be compared
//! byte-for-byte against the C reference (see `tests/ahx_render_golden.rs`).
//!
//! ## Channel count
//!
//! The song decides: AHX is always 4 voices, HVL plays its native
//! `(buf[8]>>2)+4` (`hvl_load_hvl:399`, `ht_Channels`). The one boundary point
//! is [`AhxEngine::new`]; nothing downstream knows a channel count of its own.
//! Voices beyond the fourth follow the reference unchanged: default pan repeats
//! L/R/R/L per group of four (`hvl_InitSubsong:90-108`) and every voice mixes
//! through the same `hvl_mixchunk` loop. The reference sizes its voice array at
//! [`MAX_CHANNELS`]; a wider (malformed) song is clamped to it and
//! [`AhxEngine::dropped_channels`] says how many were cut -- 0 for every real
//! file. [`AhxEngine::with_channel_cap`] truncates on purpose so tests can
//! compare a partial channel count against the reference; it is a
//! verification hook, not a product mode.
