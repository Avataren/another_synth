//! Adlib Tracker II modules (`.a2m`), batch O6 of `.ai/plan-opl.md`: the
//! container, its three packers and the song model the O7 player consumes.
//!
//! The layout comes from the tracker authors' own format description,
//! `techinfo.htm` (adlibtracker.net/files), and is checked against every
//! module in `src/tests/fixtures/opl/a2m`. Where the files disagree with that
//! document, the files win and the difference is noted where it is handled.
//! The parser was written without reading Adlib Tracker II's source (GPL 3+,
//! plan decision D1); the O7 engine's debugging later relaxed that (see
//! `engine.rs`).
//!
//! E15 discipline: `parse` either returns the whole song or refuses with one
//! true sentence. Nothing is skipped, clamped or guessed silently.
