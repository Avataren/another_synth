//! The A2M replay engine (batch O7 of `.ai/plan-opl.md`): song position,
//! rows, ticks, effects and macros, producing OPL3 register writes.
//!
//! AdPlug's port of the AT2 player is LGPL and was not read (plan decision
//! D1). Every behaviour here was pinned by running AdPlug's `Ca2mv2Player`
//! as a black box on corpus modules and on synthetic ones
//! (`oracle/craft_a2m.py`), and comparing its register writes tick by tick
//! (`oracle/trace-oracle.cpp`). "MEASURED" marks a rule read off those
//! traces. For the last divergences D1 was relaxed: Adlib Tracker II's own
//! source (GPL 3+) was read to form hypotheses, which were then probed; the
//! code here is written from those rules, not from AT2's. Names such as
//! `effect_table` or `output_note` refer to AT2 routines and tables.
